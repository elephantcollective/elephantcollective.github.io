      bio="Dylan Butman is a interactive technologist who discovered that his best self exists as a developer not just of technology, but of creative ideas and organizations. He works artistically with generative systems - organisms that exist in code and respond to their environments to reflect the inherent and emergent complexity of human, environmental, and physical life."

      bio="Stacey Spectacular is a multifaceted artist working in circus arts, performance art, event production, costume design, and several different healing modalities focused on the body and its energy field. Inspired by the fantastical world of circus, the extravagance of the Baroque period, the simplicity of the natural world, and the mechanism of the human body, her work employs juxtaposition as commentary highlighting the breadth and depth of human emotion.<br><br> Her passionate pursuit of the arts is the result of a past darkened by trauma and incest abuse, propelling her to communicate the magic, mystery, and beauty of the healing journey to the masses as her own way of encouraging others to fight their demons and celebrate the complexities life has to offer."

      bio='I look at how media and technology can be used to help people live happier, healthier lives.

To do this, I work as a business consultant and educator, and a New Media artist. This allows me to use psychology to tackle problems at the one-on-one, individual level all the way up to addressing problems facing society as a whole. I hope to leave the world a little better than I found it.

The biggest issue I work with is identity and how people "individuate" or become who they truly are on the inside. This means I can explore this issue with an individual by using art to help them discover their potential, or I can take on business clients to address how marketing and advertising can be used to bring out the best in us. A lot of my clients have been in community governance and community building, helping online communities grow and thrive.

At first, I wanted to just work a normal job, but I met some friends and allies along the way. Together, we're building some exciting things. We can solve the problems facing the world - all of them. We just have to put our heads together.'
