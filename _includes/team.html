      bio="Stacey Spectacular is a multifaceted artist working in circus arts, performance art, event production, costume design, and several different healing modalities focused on the body and its energy field. Inspired by the fantastical world of circus, the extravagance of the Baroque period, the simplicity of the natural world, and the mechanism of the human body, her work employs juxtaposition as commentary highlighting the breadth and depth of human emotion. Her passionate pursuit of the arts is the result of a past darkened by trauma and incest abuse, propelling her to communicate the magic, mystery, and beauty of the healing journey to the masses as her own way of encouraging others to fight their demons and celebrate the complexities life has to offer."
