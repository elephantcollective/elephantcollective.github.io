# The Elephant Collective

An elephant never forgets. They carry the stories of their families, environments, and ecosystems across great distances. Together, herds are rich tapestries of memory that collect the perspectives of generations.
  
The Elephant Collective is a non-profit group of artists dedicated to creating interactive art and immersive experiences that collect and transmit the stories, memories, and dreams of local communities. 

The Elephant Collective inspires and supports our members through providing the vision, space, tools, artistic development, transportation, and fundraising required to produce, maintain, and display art that is ambitious in scale, impact, and technology both nationally and internationally. We provide infrastructure, tools, and training for the creation of art cars, interactive installations, physical computing, and immersive environments that come together to create experiences populated by performances, music, and humanity to tell our stories.
